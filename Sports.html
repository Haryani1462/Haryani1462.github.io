    I just started playing volleyball last year march, but I already love it.<br>
    My bestfriend name Jonny convinced me to play volleyball<br>
    I am a right side hitter for HEHS and plan on playing club.<br>
    My goal is to play college volleyball and get a scholarship for it.<br>
    Volleyball is a huge commitment to me as I quit other sports/activities for it.<br>
